# Fingerprint-Spoofing
A simple  project to show my machine learning and pattern recognition skills.

# TODOs
Would be nice to have some sort of interactive journey...

"press 0 to plot and print some preliminary dataset analysis"
"press 1 to apply PCA"
... 


### Prio
- Revise the mean of "peak" and "modes" in the preliminar analysis, since it's not clear what a peak is, it's not clear what "one peak shown" mean.
- Revise the variances and means analysis 

### Dataset
1) Specify path to load dataset

### Various

### Analysis
1) Complete the pca + lda part
2) Complete gaussian fitting analysis
3) Complete MVG analysis
